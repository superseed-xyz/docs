# About Superseed

<Callout type="info">
  **Superseed is a secure, low-cost, open-source, developer-friendly,
  EVM-equivalent Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain that is built on the Canyon release
  of the OP Stack.**
</Callout>

## Ethereum Layer 2

_**What is a Layer 2 blockchain?**_

A Layer 2 blockchain is a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system, known as Layer 1.
They inherit security from their underlying Layer 1 by recording transaction data and final settlement on the more secure main blockchain.
The primary purpose of Layer 2 blockchains is to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the base layer by handling transactions off the main chain. This allows for faster processing times and lower transaction fees, while still maintaining the security and decentralized nature of the underlying blockchain.

In our case the Layer 1 is:

- **Superseed Mainnet** &rarr; **Ethereum Mainnet**
- **Superseed Sepolia** &rarr; **Ethereum Sepolia**

## Optimistic Rollup

_**What is a Optimistic Rollup?**_

Optimistic Rollups are Layer 2 scaling solutions that bundle (or "roll up") numerous off-chain transactions into a single batch, which is then submitted to the Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain. They operate on the principle of optimism – where transactions are assumed to be valid and only fully verified if challenged. This approach allows for increased transaction throughput and reduced gas fees while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum mainnet through periodic commitments and the option for users to dispute fraudulent activity.

_**Why choose Optimistic Rollup?**_

In the landscape of Layer 2 scaling solutions, Superseed has opted for Optimistic Rollups over zkEVMs for their balance of security and simplicity. While zkEVMs offer robust security mirroring the base chain, they often entail a steeper learning curve and increased complexity, heightening the risk of bugs and system failures. Optimistic Rollups, conversely, introduce less complexity, aligning with our goal for a developer-friendly environment. Moreover, the potential future integration of ZK-Proofs within Optimistic Rollups promises enhanced security without compromising on the system's inherent simplicity.

## The OP Stack

_**Why choose the OP Stack?**_

The OP Stack is chosen for its foundational philosophy of simplicity and modularity, which aligns with our commitment to building a user-friendly and reliable system. Its design minimizes complexity, reducing the likelihood of bugs and system failures, and its modular nature allows for easy updates and integration of new technologies, like ZK-Proofs, to future-proof our platform while maintaining security and efficiency.

  We are building our Testnet on top of the [Canyon
  release](https://blog.oplabs.co/canyon-hardfork/) of the OP Stack.

## Design Principles

Not only we inherit our design principles from the OP Stack, but as builders we very much agree with these principles because we know they work.

These principles are:

#### 1. Simplicity

#### 2. Pragmatism

#### 3. Sustainability

#### 4. Optimism
