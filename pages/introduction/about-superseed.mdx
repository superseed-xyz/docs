## Ethereum Layer 2

**_What is a Layer 2 blockchain?_**

A Layer 2 blockchain is a protocol built on top of a Layer 1 blockchain network, aimed at improving scalability and performance while maintaining security. Layer 2 protocols inherit security from Layer 1 by recording transaction data and final settlement on the base layer. Their primary purpose is to enhance scalability and efficiency by processing transactions off-chain, resulting in faster processing times and lower fees, while preserving the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain.

## Optimistic Rollup

**_What is an Optimistic Rollup?_**

Optimistic Rollups are Layer 2 scaling solutions that bundle (or "roll up") numerous off-chain transactions into a single batch, which is then submitted to the Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain. Optimistic Rollups operate on the principle of optimism – where transactions are assumed to be valid and only fully verified if challenged. This approach allows for increased transaction throughput and reduced gas fees while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum mainnet through periodic commitments and the option for users to dispute fraudulent activity.

**_Why choose Optimistic Rollups?_**

In the landscape of Layer 2 scaling solutions, Superseed has opted for Optimistic Rollups over zkEVMs for their balance of security and simplicity. While zkEVMs offer robust security mirroring the base chain, they often entail a steeper learning curve and increased complexity, heightening the risk of bugs and system failures. Optimistic Rollups, conversely, introduce less complexity, aligning with our goal for a developer-friendly environment. Moreover, the potential future integration of ZK-Proofs within Optimistic Rollups promises enhanced security without compromising on the system's inherent simplicity.

## The OP Stack

**_Why choose the OP Stack?_**

The OP Stack is chosen for its foundational philosophy of simplicity and modularity, which aligns with our commitment to building a user-friendly and reliable system. Its design minimizes complexity, reducing the likelihood of bugs and system failures. Additionally, its modular nature allows for easy updates and the integration of new technologies, like ZK-Proofs. This approach future-proofs our platform while ensuring security and efficiency.

<Callout>
  We are building our Testnet on top of the [Bedrock
  release](https://blog.oplabs.co/introducing-optimism-bedrock/) of the OP
  Stack.

## Design Principles

We adopt the OP Stack's design principles because, as builders, we know they work and strongly align with our values.
