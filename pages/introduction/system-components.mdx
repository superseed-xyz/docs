# System components (Overview)

## Layer 1 (L1) Components

### OptimismPortal

A conduit for L2 transactions originating from L1 smart contract calls.

- The `OptimismPortal` contract emits `TransactionDeposited` events, which the rollup driver interprets to process deposits.
- Deposits are assured to be reflected in the L2 state within a defined *sequencing window*.
- Note that *transactions* are deposited, not tokens, though deposited transactions are crucial for implementing token deposits (tokens are locked on L1 and minted on L2 via a deposited transaction).

### BatchInbox

An L1 address where the Batch Submitter deposits transaction batches.

- Transaction batches contain L2 transaction calldata, timestamps, and ordering data.
- The BatchInbox operates as a standard EOA address, enabling gas cost savings by bypassing EVM code execution.

### L2OutputOracle

A smart contract that retains **L2 output roots** for withdrawals and fault proofs application.

## Layer 2 (L2) Components

### Rollup Node

- Operates as a standalone, stateless binary.
- Accepts L2 transactions from users.
- Synchronizes and validates rollup data on L1.
- Applies rollup-specific block production rules to create blocks from L1.
- Appends blocks to the L2 chain using the Engine API.
- Manages L1 reorganizations (reorgs).
- Distributes unsubmitted blocks to other rollup nodes.

### Execution Engine

- Functions as a Geth node, slightly modified to support Superseed.
- Preserves the L2 state.
- Synchronizes state across other L2 nodes to facilitate swift onboarding.
- Provides the Engine API to the rollup node.

### Batch Submitter

- A background operation that submits transaction batches to the `BatchInbox` address.

### Output Submitter

- A background operation that submits L2 output commitments to the `L2OutputOracle`.
