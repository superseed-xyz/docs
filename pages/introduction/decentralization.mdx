# Path to Decentralization

We at Superseed are committed to the principles of decentralization. As such we are designing and building the Superseed network to enable a future transition of control to the Superseed DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

DAOs have become the gold standard in the crypto industry for projects aiming for decentralization. They enable the community to control a project's governance mechanism. DAOs can be used to propose changes, vote on them, and even implement these changes.

The Superseed DAO will be governed via the Superseed token and the amount of voting power someone has will be determined by the number of tokens that they hold. There will also be the option for token holders to grant their voting power to a Delegate who will be able to vote on their behalf.
