# Decentralization

We at Superseed are committed to the principles of decentralization. 
As such we are designing and building the Superseed network in ways that will make it possible to transition the control over the network to what will become the Superseed DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

DAOs have become the gold standard in the crypto industry for projects that want to become decentralized as they allow the community to take control of the governance mechanism of a project and can be used to propose changes, vote and even deploy them.

The Superseed DAO will be governed via the Superseed token and the amount of voting power someone has will be determined by the number of tokens that they hold.
There will also be the option for token holders to grant their voting power to a Delegate who will be able to vote on their behalf.
