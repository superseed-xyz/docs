Hardhat is recognised for being flexible, extensible and fast in the Ethereum smart contract development.

## Configuring Hardhat for Arkantum

To prepare Hardhat for deployment on the Arkantum networks, make the necessary adjustments to your `hardhat.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  networks: {
    // For Arkantum Mainnet
    "arkantum-mainnet": {
      url: "<https://mainnet.arkantum.org>",
      accounts: [process.env.WALLET_KEY as string],
      gasPrice: 1000000000,
    },
    // For Arkantum Sepolia Testnet
    "arkantum-sepolia": {
      url: "<https://sepolia.arkantum.org>",
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string],
      gasPrice: 1000000000,
    },
    // For local development environment
    "arkantum-local": {
      url: "<http://localhost:8545>",
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string],
      gasPrice: 1000000000,
    },
  },
  defaultNetwork: "arkantum-local",
};

export default config;
```

## Your Smart Contracts on Arkantum Mainnet

### Deployment

Use Hardhat's deployment scripts, specifying the network:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network arkantum-mainnet
```

### Verification

After deploying, verify your smart contract using Hardhat's built-in verification tool:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network arkantum-mainnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1"
```

<Callout emoji="💬">
  Remember to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `"Constructor argument 1"`
  with the actual address of your deployed contract and any necessary
  constructor parameters.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  For deploying on the Arkantum Testnet, just replace the `—-network` parameter
  with your desired network.

  The provided configurations and commands are aimed at offering a simple
  start-up process for developers working with Hardhat on the Arkantum
  blockchain. Adjustments may be needed based on specific contract requirements
  or network preferences.
