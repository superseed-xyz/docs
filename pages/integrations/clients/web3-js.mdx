# web3.js

The [web3.js](https://web3js.org/) library is a JavaScript library designed to facilitate the interaction with nodes on EVM-compatible blockchains such as Superseed.

Use web3.js for efficient communication with smart contracts on the Superseed network.

## Installation

To add web3.js to your development environment, install it with the following command:

```bash
npm install web3
```

## Configuration

Begin by importing web3.js at the top of your JavaScript file to get started:

```jsx
const Web3 = require("web3");
```

## Connecting to Superseed Sepolia Testnet

Create a link to the Superseed Sepolia network by instantiating a web3.js object, targeting the RPC endpoint of an Superseed node:

```jsx
const Web3 = require("web3");

// For Superseed Sepolia Testnet
const web3 = new Web3("https://sepolia.superseed.xyz");

```
