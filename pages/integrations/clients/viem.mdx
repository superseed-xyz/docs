[Viem](https://viem.sh/) is a full featured lightweight javascript library for interacting with EVM chains with first class support for Superseed.

Viem is used by [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) and [Rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/).

The [Viem docs](https://viem.sh/docs/getting-started.html) have excellent examples of how to use it in your project.
