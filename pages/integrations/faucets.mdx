# Faucets

Faucets are developers tools that allow you to get free ETH (and other tokens) on test networks like Ethereum Sepolia so that you can send transactions and create smart contracts.

Here you'll find a list of active faucets that you can try out. Different faucets use different authentication methods, so you may have to try a few before you find one that works for you.

Faucets can occasionally also run out of ETH, so if you're having trouble getting ETH from a faucet, try another one.
