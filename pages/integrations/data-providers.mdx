## The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. The Graph makes it possible to query data that is difficult to query directly.

Applications built on Arkantum can leverage GraphQL for querying open APIs, known as subgraphs, which are structured to pull indexed data from the network.

For initial steps, refer to the [documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/) for detailed instructions on creating, deploying, and querying an Arkantum subgraph.
