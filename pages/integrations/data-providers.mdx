# Data Providers

## Goldsky

Goldsky serves as a go-to data indexer for web3 builders, offering two core self-serve products: Subgraphs and Mirror. 
These products can be used independently or in conjunction to power your data stack.

1. **Subgraphs**: high-performance subgraphs that provide flexible indexing with TypeScript support, webhooks, and more. 
Developers can deploy subgraphs to Goldsky, making Superseed data accessible via hosted API endpoints or directly within their own infrastructure. 
Additionally, Superseed subgraphs deployed to Goldsky can be replicated into internal datastores using Goldsky Mirror. 
This integration allows live blockchain data to flow directly into databases or message queues with a single YAML configuration, enabling alternative access patterns and joins with other application or user data.

2. **Mirror**: real-time data replication pipelines. It allows you to stream live blockchain data into your own infrastructure. 
By leveraging Goldsky hosted subgraphs as a data source, you can connect to various sinks without any data lag. 

For detailed documentation and quick start guides, you can explore the [Goldsky Subgraphs](https://docs.goldsky.com/subgraphs) and [Goldsky Mirror](https://docs.goldsky.com/mirror) resources. ðŸš€

## SubQuery

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast, flexible, universal, open source and decentralised APIs for web3 projects. SubQuery SDK allows developers to get rich indexed data and build intuitive and immersive decentralised applications in a faster and more efficient way.

Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project. This allows the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics and multi-chain block scanners. Other advantages include superior performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture.

### Running and Hosting your Superseed SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is open-source and designed to be easy to run, meaning you have the freedom to run it a variety of ways:

- [Locally on your own computer or on your cloud provider of choice.](https://subquery.network/doc/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#locally-run-it-yourself)
- [By publishing it to the decentralised SubQuery Network](https://subquery.network/doc/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#publish-to-the-subquery-network), the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers.
- [Leveraging a centralised hosting partner in the SubQuery community](https://subquery.network/doc/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#other-hosting-providers-in-the-subquery-community), like OnFinality or Traceye.
