# ethers.js

[ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) is a JavaScript library for developers working with EVM-compatible blockchains, offering an easy way to interact with the Superseed blockchain.

This library facilitates the interaction with smart contracts deployed on Superseed.

### Installation

```bash
npm install --save ethers
```

### Setup

To make ethers.js available in your project, preface your code with the following import statement:

```jsx
const ethers = require("ethers");
```

### Connecting to Superseed Sepolia Testnet

For connections to the Superseed Sepolia network, initialize an ethers.js `JsonRpcProvider` object with the Superseed Sepolia RPC URL:

```jsx
const ethers = require("ethers");

const url = "https://sepolia.superseed.xyz";
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(url);
```
