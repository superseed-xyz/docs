# Using Hardhat for Superseed Development

Hardhat is recognised for being flexible, extensible and fast in the Ethereum smart contract development.

## Configuring Hardhat for Superseed

To prepare Hardhat for deployment on the Superseed networks, make the necessary adjustments to your `hardhat.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  networks: {   
    // For Superseed Sepolia Testnet
    "superseed-sepolia": {
      url: "https://sepolia.superseed.xyz",
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string],
      gasPrice: 1000000000,
    },
    // For local development environment
    "superseed-local": {
      url: "http://localhost:8545",
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string],
      gasPrice: 1000000000,
    },
  },
  defaultNetwork: "superseed-local",
};

export default config;
```

## Your Smart Contracts on Superseed Testnet

### Deployment

Use Hardhat's deployment scripts, specifying the network:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network superseed-sepolia
```

### Verification

After deploying, verify your smart contract using Hardhat's built-in verification tool:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network superseed-sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1"
```

  Remember to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `"Constructor argument 1"`
  with the actual address of your deployed contract and any necessary
  constructor parameters.

  The provided configurations and commands are aimed at offering a simple
  start-up process for developers working with Hardhat on the Superseed
  blockchain. Adjustments may be needed based on specific contract requirements
  or network preferences.
