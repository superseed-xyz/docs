# Transaction Fees on Superseed

Superseed is designed to be EVM equivalent, reusing Ethereum code and mimicking its behavior. 
However, transaction fees on Superseed will have small differences Ethereum for several reasons. 
This guide details how transaction fees work on Superseed, helping you account for them in your applications.

## L2 Execution Fee

This fee is identical to the one on Ethereum. 
It’s calculated as the gas used by the transaction multiplied by the gas price. 
Superseed employs the [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) mechanism to set the base fee and an optional priority fee.

### Base Fee

The base fee is the minimum price per gas unit that must be paid for a transaction to be included in a block. 
Transactions must specify a maximum base fee higher than the block base fee to be included. 
The actual fee charged is the block base fee, even if the transaction specifies a higher maximum base fee.

### Priority Fee

Transactions can optionally specify a priority fee, an additional price per gas unit paid on top of the base fee. 
The Superseed sequencer prioritizes transactions with higher priority fees, executing them faster.

## L1 Data Fee

This fee covers the cost of publishing transaction data to Ethereum, ensuring its availability for node download and execution. 
This fee is mainly determined by Ethereum's base fee and, post-Ecotone upgrade, the Ethereum blob data gas price.

The L1 Data Fee is automatically charged and deducted from the sender’s address. 
It’s influenced by the estimated transaction size, the current Ethereum gas price, and several parameters.
