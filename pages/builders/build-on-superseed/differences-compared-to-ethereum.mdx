# Differences compared to Ethereum

Superseed is built on the [Bedrock](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/explainer/) release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which aims to closely resemble Ethereum. As a result, there are few differences between building on Superseed and Ethereum. However, itâ€™s important to keep in mind these differences when developing apps on Superseed. 

These differences include:

- [Opcodes](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#opcodes)
- [Address Aliasing](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#address-aliasing)
- [Transaction Fees](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees)
- [EIP-1559 Parameters](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#eip-1559-parameters)
- [Mempool Rules](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#eip-1559-parameters)
