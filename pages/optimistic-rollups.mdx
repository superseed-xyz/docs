# Optimistic Rollups

Optimistic rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution designed to increase the throughput of Ethereum-based applications without compromising on security. They function by executing most transactions off-chain while periodically submitting a summary, or "rollup", of those transactions to the Ethereum mainnet. This allows for a significant reduction in the amount of data stored on-chain, leading to faster and cheaper transactions.

It's essential to understand that optimistic rollups offer a balance between scalability and security. While they offload much of the computational work from the mainnet, they still rely on its security guarantees. Any discrepancies or fraudulent activities in the off-chain transactions can be challenged and corrected on-chain. This ensures that, even though operations are scaled, the integrity and trustworthiness of the system remain intact.
