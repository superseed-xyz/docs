# Decentralization

We at Arkantum are committed to the principles of decentralization. 
As such we are designing and building the Arkantum network in ways that will make it possible to transition the control over the network to what will become the Arkantum DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

DAOs have become the gold standard in the crypto industry for projects that want to become decentralized as they allow the community to take control of the governance mechanism of a project and can be used to propose changes, vote and even deploy them.

The Arkantum DAO will be governed via the Arkantum token and the amount of voting power someone has will be determined by the number of tokens that they hold.
There will also be the option for token holders to grant their voting power to a Delegate who will be able to vote on their behalf.
