# About Arkantum

Arkantum is a cutting-edge Layer 2 blockchain protocol built atop the OP Stack, leveraging the robust foundation of Optimism. Arkantum offers enhanced scalability, rapid finality, and inherits the battle-tested technology of Optimism. 

Our design is rooted in the core principles of Optimism: simplicity, pragmatism, sustainability, and optimism. By integrating these principles, Arkantum ensures streamlined transaction sequencing, efficient deterministic execution, and seamless cross-chain functionalities.

Furthermore, Arkantum commits transaction outcomes to the foundational Layer 1 chain using an advanced rollup protocol, ensuring both speed and security.
