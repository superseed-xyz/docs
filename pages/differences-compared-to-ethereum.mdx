# Differences compared to Ethereum

Arkantum is built on the [Bedrock](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/explainer/) release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which aims to closely resemble Ethereum. As a result, there are few differences between building on Arkantum and Ethereum.

However, it is important to note some minor discrepancies between Arkantum and Ethereum when developing apps on Arkantum. These differences include:

## Opcodes

| Opcode | Solidity equivalent | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COINBASE` | `block.coinbase` | Undefined |
| `DIFFICULTY` | `block.difficulty` | Random value. As this value is set by the sequencer, it is not as reliably random as the L1 equivalent. |
| `NUMBER` | `block.number` | L2 block number |
| `TIMESTAMP` | `block.timestamp` | Timestamp of the L2 block |
| `ORIGIN` | `tx.origin` | If the transaction is an L1 ⇒ L2 transaction, then `tx.origin` is set to the `address-aliasing` of the address that triggered the L1 ⇒ L2 transaction. Otherwise, this opcode behaves normally. |
| `CALLER` | `msg.sender` | If the transaction is an L1 ⇒ L2 transaction, and this is the initial call (rather than an internal transaction from one contract to another), the same address-aliasing behavior applies. |

## Blocks

| Parameter | L1 Ethereum | Arkantum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time between blocks | 12 seconds(1) | 2 seconds |
| Block target size | 15,000,000 gas | to be determined |
| Block maximum size | 30,000,000 gas | to be determined |

## Network specifications

### JSON-RPC differences

OP Stack codebase uses the same [JSON-RPC API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API) as Ethereum. Some additional OP Stack specific methods have been introduced. See the full list of [custom JSON-RPC methods](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/json-rpc/) for more information.

### Pre-EIP-155 support

[Pre-EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) transactions do not have a chain ID, which means a transaction on one Ethereum blockchain can be replayed on others. This is a security risk, so pre-EIP-155 transactions are not supported on OP Stack by default.

## Transaction costs

Transaction costs on OP Stack chains, by default, include an L2 execution fee and an L1 data fee as exaplained below.
