# About Us

Our vision of the future is one that aims at humans thriving with responsible freedom. 
For humans to thrive we need our time to be spent as efficient as possible, and for this we need a decentralised value-chain that will move value according to the individual's needs.
At the moment there are limiting factors in the decentralised ecosystem, and we aim to solve some of these problems. 
The Optimism Collective's vision is enabling this by creating a platform where we can innovate and grow the whole space.

## We are Optimists

***Why not build something new?***

Because we are builders, and we know that composability is a good thing, so rolling our own code would have been counterproductive.
OP Stack is built on a modular architecture, so we can contribute with solutions and innovations to existing problems instead of building something new.

We are committed to contribute to Optimism in a positive manner for the growth of the whole ecosystem.

### We care about Decentralization

Because a centralised system is under the control of a single entity, whereas decentralized technology is managed by a distributed network, immune to control or shutdown by any single actor. A more in-depth analysis of why a decentralised system is better than a centralised one here: [https://petkanics.medium.com/the-benefits-of-decentralization-88a0b5d0fd39](https://petkanics.medium.com/the-benefits-of-decentralization-88a0b5d0fd39).

Our chain will be governed by a DAO and we will also participate in the Optimism Superchain.

### We care about Privacy

We are designing our platform with Privacy in mind. Our users will benefit from the latest technologies and DeFi applications while being protected from bad actors.

How will we achieve this? We know how crypto works, we faced the same problems ourselves, one of the reasons we started this project was to fix the issues we were having. So we will bring to our platform the right projects that care about their users more than anything else, even profit, and incentivize the ones that make a positive contribution to our ecosystem.

### We are human-centric

We design our platform to maximize the output for the application users while also understanding the builder's perspective and showing them all of the support they need to create a great product.
