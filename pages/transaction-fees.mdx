# Transaction Fees

## Arkantum Fee Structure

Arkantum transactions incur two primary costs: the L2 execution fee and the L1 security fee, each crucial for transaction execution and security across the network.

### L2 Execution Fee

The L2 fee, associated with processing transactions on Arkantum Layer 2, adjusts dynamically based on transaction volume, increasing during high demand and decreasing otherwise.

### L1 Security Fee

The L1 fee, tied to anchoring transactions to the foundational Ethereum layer, typically exceeds the L2 fee and fluctuates with Ethereum network gas prices. Strategic transaction timing, such as initiating during off-peak hours, can optimize cost-efficiency.
