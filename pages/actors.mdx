# Actors

There are three types of actors in the Arkantum ecosystem.

## Users

There are 2 categories of Users, builders and app consumers.

The builders will typically deploy contracts and deploy dApps while the app consumers will typically use these dApps.

This group consists of parties that use this blockchain either through a wallet (like Metamask), a multisig (like the Safe â€” formerly Gnosis Safe), or a dApp.

Members of this group can send tokens or ETH to other users.

They can also interact with contracts by sending transactions to the Layer 2 blockchain.

## Sequencers

The sequencer, acting as the principal block producer, plays a pivotal role in transaction management and block production. While the 1.0.0 version operates with a single sequencer under the Arkantum DAO's oversight, future iterations may employ multiple sequencers through a consensus protocol.

Key Responsibilities of the Sequencer:

1. **Off-chain Transaction Management:** Accepts and manages user transactions executed off-chain.
2. **On-chain Transaction Monitoring:** Monitors on-chain transactions, focusing on deposit events from L1.
3. **Transaction Consolidation:** Merges off-chain and on-chain transactions into organized L2 blocks.
4. **L2 Block Propagation to L1:** Submits consolidated L2 blocks to L1, including pending off-chain transactions and requisite information to reconstruct the transaction order from L1 observations.

Furthermore, the sequencer facilitates access to block data as early as the consolidation phase, offering users the option to access the real-time state prior to L1 confirmation.

## Verifiers

Important within the network infrastructure, verifiers, ensuring integrity and accessibility, execute two paramount functions:

1. **Data Provision:** They facilitate user access by serving Layer 2 data.
2. **Integrity Assurance:** They validate Layer 2 integrity and challenge invalid assertions.

Preserving network security necessitates **at least** one honest verifier, tasked with safeguarding the integrity of Layer 2 and ensuring the reliable dissemination of blockchain data to users. This verifier acts as a shield against potential discrepancies and sustains the unbroken availability of user data.
