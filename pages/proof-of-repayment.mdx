# Proof-of-Repayment

Proof-of-Repayment (PoR) is a mechanism designed to programmatically reward anyone who repays the loans of supercollateral borrowers.

The Superseed token has a yearly 2% supply inflation, distributed daily through auctions. In these auctions, repayers compete to win the reward by committing the highest amount of stablecoins to repay the loans of supercollateral borrowers.

The winner of the auction receives the daily reward and the stables that they committed for repayment get added to a repayment vault to be used for repaying the loans of supercollateral users while the rest of the bidders who lost the auction can claim back the stables they committed.
